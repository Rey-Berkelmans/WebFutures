# WebFutures

In this project, I will be experimenting with web technologies, both new and old, to develop an experimental interactive interface.

I will be focusing towards the following outcomes:

1. Identifying and critiquing a range of front-end web design concepts, skills, and theories.
2. Experimentation with the creation of web-based interactive interfaces using appropriate concepts and techniques.
3. Reviewing and evaluating appropriate development methodologies in the creation of interactive works.

Throughout this project I will be forced to leverage my front-end web design skills to push the boundaries of front-end web design to create a responsive web-based interface.

The development of this project began with utilising a generative artificial intelligence tool, and in this circumstance, ChatGPT, to provide a basic foundation to build upon. Attached below is an image taken from a website created off of this foundation code.

The design for this website created from ChatGPTâ€™s code can be described as bland and poor design. It is not an impressive site and is not suitable code for a fully functional website. However, I have continued to develop this project of a web-based interface off of this code developed by ChatGPT.

Additionally, there was some code that was created from ChatGPT for this project that was non-functional. This code was Javascript code created that would add a fading transition effect whenever the pages are swapped via the navigation. However, despite using the code the way ChatGPT stated to, it was simply nonfunctional. This code is still in the Javascript file to demonstrate this.

The reason I personally believe this has happened was due to the way ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence tools collect and use their code. These tools simply gather pre-written code from across the internet to create its own code. However, it is impossible for these tools to understand the code fully the way a human may, along with being unable to check or run the code to check its functionality, which can result in this unfunctional code.

After the creation of this base code, AI generated code was not used afterwards, and I began working towards the development of front-end concepts to achieve my design goals. The main front-end concepts I worked towards for this code was composition, repetition, colour, and interactivity. 

However, throughout the development for this project, I did face numerous challenges throughout the process. This included attempting to add functions to this website which simply were nonfunctional, including drop-down menus and image carousels. Another one of these examples included when, for an unknown reason, the code was preventing me from scrolling down on pages on mobile screens. Although I am still unsure if this issue was caused by my own code or due to my device, I was eventually able to resolve these issues by simply making sure the pages would be formatted and fit correctly on a phone screen, mainly by utilising media queries and removing unnecessary content.

Throughout this project I have learnt numerous lessons and made improvements. My main lesson revolves around how Artificial Intelligence negatively impacts code. Throughout this project I have additionally learnt more about front-end design techniques, and how to utilise web technologies, both new and old, to create an experimental interactive interface.
